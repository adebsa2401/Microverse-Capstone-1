# Microverse First Final Capstone Project

> This is the repository of the first capstone project done during the Microverse's Software developer program. During this project, we built the first capstone project. This project involves building a two-pages website presenting an event. In our case, we present a Global Summit about the Machine Artificial Intelligence topic. The pages design can be found [here](https://www.behance.net/gallery/29845175/CC-Global-Summit-2015). To build these pages, we used html, css (pure) and javascript (pure). The pages responsiveness has been handled by using css media queries. To render the speakers list on the home page, we've used javascript arrays to store the speakers data then we render that section dynamically in javascript


## Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JS

## Live Demo

Go ahead this [loom video]() to have a deeper insight on the features we implemented in that project.
